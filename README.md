# Full Stack Svelte Prototype

A prototype framework (?) for making full-stack Svelte apps that is improving my life a lot. Features: code-splitting per page, server-side rendering, automatic client-side component mounting, automatic AJAXy POST requests, primitive cache-busting.

Look at `routes/` for crappy examples. Run with `npm run start`. Routes are compiled on server-start.
